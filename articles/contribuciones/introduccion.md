## About your contributions to Midas content

### Minor corrections
Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repo are covered by the general terms.


## Repository organization
The content in the Midas-docs repository follows the organization of documentation on https://docs.Midas.com/Midas/. This repository contains two root folders:

### \articles
The *\articles* folder contains the documentation articles formatted as markdown files with an *.md* extension. Articles are typically grouped by Midas Services.

The *\articles* folder contains the *\media* folder for root directory article media files, inside which are subfolders with the images for each article.  The service folders contain a separate media folder for the articles within each service folder. The article image folders are named identically to the article file, minus the *.md* file extension.

### \includes
You can create reusable content sections to be included in one or more articles. 

## How to use markdown to format your topic
All the articles in this repository use GitHub flavored markdown.  Here's a list of resources.
